# Axiom 1 — Discrete Golden Scale Symmetry

**Enunciation**
The vacuum is invariant under the discrete group ℤ generated by the golden ratio φ = (1 + √5)/2.
There exists a unitary operator S ∈ U(ℋ) such that
S |ψ⟩ = φ^n |ψ⟩ ,  n ∈ ℤ
for some integer n labelling the scale sector of |ψ⟩.

**Algebraic closure**
φ satisfies the minimal polynomial x² − x − 1 = 0 over ℚ,
hence ℤ[φ, φ^(−1)] = ℤ[φ] is the ring of integers of ℚ(ℚ(√5)).

**Spectral theorem**
The self-adjoint generator Λ = ln S has pure point spectrum
$$\sigma(\Lambda) = \{ n \ln \varphi \, | \, n \in \mathbb{Z} \}$$
with exact degeneracies determined solely by representation theory of ℤ.

**No continuous scale parameter appears at any stage of the theory.**
