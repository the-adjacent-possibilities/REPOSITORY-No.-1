\textbf{Enunciation}
The observed Higgs VEV $v$ and the Planck mass $M_{Pl}$ are adjacent in the discrete $\varphi$-scale spectrum, fixed by the observed ratio:
$$v = M_{Pl} \cdot \varphi^{-130} \quad \text{exactly}$$

The vacuum energy density is determined by the $\varphi$-fractal measure of the Planck-scale instanton core on $\mathcal{M}_{vac}$:
$$\Lambda_{\text{CFT}} = M_{Pl}^4 \cdot \varphi^{-260}$$

\textbf{Corollaries}
The Hierarchy Problem and the Cosmological Constant Problem are solved by the exact, topologically-constrained $\varphi$-power $\varphi^{-130}$ and its square $\varphi^{-260}$.
